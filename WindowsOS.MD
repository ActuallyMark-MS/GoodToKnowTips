# WindowsOS Tips

# Remove the stale entry via “Programs and Features” (Legacy View)
Sometimes the modern Settings → Apps view misses things, but the classic control panel still allows cleanup.

Press Win + R
Type:

~~~ appwiz.cpl

Look for the old application.

If it appears, try Right-click → Uninstall.
It may prompt that files are missing—allow cleanup if offered.
